# Nice plugin for Trackmania

Sometimes you drive a "nice" time, and that deserves recognition. You probably won't receive this from your wife, girlfriend or mother, and other people just don't recognize nor appreciate a "nice" number when they see one. They might even claim you're childish, even if you're a 44yo male with a job, a wife, a house, children, ...  

But fear not, we've got you covered! Every time you hit a checkpoint and your time is either 69 seconds (aka 1:09.xxx), 69 hundreds (x:xx.69x), or 69 thousands (x:xx:x69), the accomplishment will be celebrated with a nice "Nice". And who knows we might even throw in a bonus for the sake of 420!  
 
Have a nice run!
